slug: 'a-law-firm-website-to-help-new-clients-learn-and-reach-out-to-the-firm'
subtitle: 'for Frost Law Firm, PC'
excerpt: 'I used Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and styled-components. 
<br /><br />
I also used SendGrid and Formik to submit customer contact information to a Frost Law Firm email account.
<br /><br /> 
They wanted a "small mom and pop shop" feel and their clients are typically less tech-familiar seniors who may be diagnosed with cancer. I researched web accessibility and balanced design choices that reflected what I found with some aesthetics Frost Law Firm wanted.'
