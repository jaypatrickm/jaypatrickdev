subtitle: 'at iHerb'
excerpt: 'I started as a web applications developer and was promoted to software developer as I gained more experience working with C# and MySQL. I mainly focused on the front end but occasionally looked into back end issues and saw if I could solve the problem.
<br /><br />
I learned to code in C# on the job as our codebase was in .NET. Most of my day was writing in JavaScript, jQuery, SCSS, and C#.
<br /><br />
I was part of team projects on My Account pages, Orders pages, and Rewards pages: building customer-facing and internal front end.'
